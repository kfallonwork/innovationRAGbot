# The Efficiency of Content

Here at Waterstons it is graduate recruitment season. Many of our teams are picking through literally hundreds of applications looking for the bright young things that will become our next round of smarter-than-ever consultants. It’s hard work. Especially making sure that we are giving every anonymised applicant due attention.

This year AI has made the process harder than ever. Some teams are estimating that 95% of their applications have been either written or adapted by ChatGPT. I'll admit that I (Alex) was sceptical of this stat until I was presented with application after application using the same sentence structures and often the same words just in a slightly different order.

A ChatGPT prompt including instructions on how to write a good application for a job at Waterstons including looking at our values, aligning qualities with the business and providing concrete examples to build authenticity.
This is a real prompt a candidate accidentally left in an application for one of our teams.
I can completely understand this though. The advice for graduates these days is truly bananas. Learn everything you can about the companies you’re applying to! Tailor your CV to each individual job! Double check your work for spelling errors, typos, logical incongruities, the passive voice, colloquialisms, anachronisms! Work out who is most likely to assess your application and write it specifically for them!

Imagine having to do that for the hundreds of jobs you’re going to have to apply for. Back in the early noughts when I was looking for my first graduate job I think I applied for 4 games companies with the same CV and a marginally different covering letter so I have enormous sympathy for students these days. I know for certain that I would use ChatGPT to make that whole application process easier if I was going through it all again now. 

And there in would be my downfall.

I have written before about how ChatGPT struggles with true creativity. There are literally no new ideas with a large language model. That’s just not how it works. And it really shows when you are reviewing hundreds of applications. It is completely impossible to differentiate yourself if you are a swimming in a sea of mostly identical AI-composed responses.

Just imagine, for a moment, how many litres of water evaporated generating all the job applications all the graduates in the world sent you last week. How are you going to account for that in your sustainability metrics?

I recall back in the noughts my friends who were applying to do internships at Deloitte and PwC and the big banks were all told by our careers service to print their CVs on the heaviest weight paper they could find. That way when the assessors were riffling through a stack of five hundred thousand CVs yours would have a satisfying weight to it and wouldn’t go straight in the bin. What is the equivalent of spritzing your cover letter in Channel No. 5 in the age of AI?

The best person I have ever hired knocked on the door of our office wearing a shirt and tie, his BMX bike propped against the window of the bathroom company next door and handed his CV to the first person who answered. His covering letter was full of spelling mistakes but we got him straight in for an interview because he’d taken the time to cycle all the way across town and he’d been brave enough to just knock on the door. As a reviewer how can you assess the effort someone put in when all the applications have had any indication of the vagaries of humanity rapidly smoothed out of them?

I actually think the best solution to both these problems is not technological. It requires a total cultural mindset shift that not only fixes the job application process but makes many work tasks much more efficient. Before we get there though we need to change tack.

The quantity of boilerplate in your business is now visibly affecting your bottom line, your sustainability goals and your Net Zero reporting.

One of the things we are regularly asked is whether boilerplate documentation could be automated using generative AI. We have had many conversations about removing the grunt work from sales proposals, legal contracts and myriad other documents using AI. Everyone wants to free up the people writing all this content that nobody ever reads so that they can “get on with their actual jobs”. They all say “If we could just automate this bit that’s mostly the same every time then we’d get so much more done!”

This image cost half a litre of water to make. ChatGPT named the image “Symbolic Image” which made me laugh.
One of the interesting things about automating your boilerplate is that the cost is suddenly easily measurable. No longer hidden inside an individual’s salary, there is now a line item in your operational expenses that says “API charges for AI sales proposal generation”. Every time someone hits that button to create a new document that number quietly ticks up right along with your energy usage, net carbon and water consumption. The quantity of boilerplate in your business is now visibly affecting your bottom line, your sustainability goals and your Net Zero reporting.

Just imagine, for a moment, how many litres of water evaporated generating all the job applications all the graduates in the world sent you last week. How are you going to account for that in your sustainability metrics? 

I for one, and this may be wishful thinking, can’t see AI generated content that nobody reads surviving this run in. How can we burn all this cash and so many resources on output with little justifiable purpose? Maybe we should strive to stop creating boilerplate completely? What if our sales proposals were two pages instead of twenty? What if our application processes didn’t prompt five hundred homogenised responses?

There is an old adage in software development that the most efficient code is the code that doesn’t run at all. 

In this age of generative AI the most efficient content is the content that wasn’t created at all.

It feels a bit like we’ve been bashing AI for a little while now and this article by friend of the substack Hugh Wallace does nothing to abate that but it’s really worth reading.

Bartenders have long been purveyors of sound counsel as well as booze, lending an ear to many a life problem. What if we staffed a City of London pub entirely with retired consultants and so you could drink a pint while they provided sage advice on your business process problems?
