## Our experience getting 3D scanned. Connecting Everything, Everywhere. Waterstons Innovation: The Dots #14

Last week the Innovation team visited PROTO, a digital production facility based in Gateshead where we were introduced to the exciting technologies used in virtual production and 3D scanning. We also made our very own 3D models using the 3D scans taken using their photogrammetry stage. Here, Katie explains how these technologies work, what you can do with a 3D model of yourself, and how this technology could be applied to some real-world use cases.

What is this? This is The Dots, our newsletter about exciting things we find in the world of innovation. We imagine innovation as connecting the dots; putting together a jigsaw. Our puzzle pieces are the pieces of interesting information we absorb in the world, our partners and their products. Innovation happens when we connect these pieces in new and interesting ways. This newsletter is about these dots we find and connect.

### Our Visit to PROTO
Last week, we visited PROTO - The first digital production facility of its kind in Europe offering virtual production, 3D scanning, motion capture and sound recording in Gateshead. During our visit, I (Katie) learned how virtual production stages work, as well as made my own 3D scans in their state-of-the-art photogrammetry stage.


The virtual production stage at PROTO.
What is a virtual production stage?
Have you seen the Mandalorian? This TV show was filmed using a virtual production stage. The LED screen is used to create a virtual environment which is updated in real-time. Cameras with sensors are used to track movements and positions, which is used to adjust perspective of virtual environment to match the camera’s viewpoint.


The photogrammetry stage at PROTO.
What is a photogrammetry stage?
The stage is surrounded by 120 cameras, a person stands at the central point of these cameras and photos are taken simultaneously to capture all of the person or object. These images can then be aligned to generate a 3D point-cloud of the object which is then converted into a 3D model. This can all be done in photogrammetric processing software, such as Reality Capture and Agisoft Metashape.

What can we do with these 3D scans?
There are a ton of use cases for these 3D scans, including use in video games, immersive experiences and in film. Here are some of the things I hope to do with these scans:

Clean up the models and 3D print them!

Animate them:

Mixamo is a website that allows you to upload your 3D models and animate them. You can make your character dance, fight, and even fly.

MetaHuman allows you to upload a 3D model of your face and animate your facial features to mimic recordings of you. It is frequently used in film production when actors play a character that isn’t themselvses.

### How is this useful?
It’s important to note that this technology is not limited to film and video games; it has pretty exciting real-world applications. For example, architects could use virtual production to tour clients through their buildings. Virtual production stages also allow you to enter dangerous environments, so tours of factory floors with dangerous machinery can be safely conducted by manufacturers.

In terms of 3D scans, universities could use 3D scans of objects and historical figures to allow students to get up-close to them. Students at Durhack 2023 created the Digital Pantheon, an infinite museum that takes 3D objects from museums and displays these in VR.
