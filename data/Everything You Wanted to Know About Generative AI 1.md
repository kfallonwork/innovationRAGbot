# Everything You Wanted to Know About Generative AI (but were too afraid to ask) Part 1
## Do you have questions about AI? We want to answer them! Waterstons Innovation: Adventures in Innovation #5.


Generative AI is at the peak of hype at the moment. In recent weeks Alex and I have been in constant discussions with clients and partners about AI. We see it discussed at almost all levels of an organisation and with it often being incorrectly thought of as a solution to almost every problem. But what is it, and what problems can it actually solve?

We are not interested in the hype around it, and the claims that it will solve every problem and automate every process. What we are interested in is practical applications - where can we use it to bring real value, and really help to make people more efficient? This is part 1 in our ‚Äúeverything you wanted to know more about AI‚Äù series, where we are going to look at real-world examples we have already been seeing AI used for. In later parts, we will look at our concerns, recommendations on how to use and deploy it, and why we are excited.

What is this newsletter normally though? We want to think out loud and share with you the work we do and the process we use to get there - whether we are successful or not. An important part of innovation, as we see it, is partnering and collaborating with other folks to achieve things you couldn‚Äôt do by yourself. Adventures in Innovation is our bi-weekly newsletter to document the journeys we go on to meet all these amazing people.

### Gen AI: What is it, really?
Generative AI is a tool that can generate huge amounts of text and images based on a prompt you give it. If you ask it a question, it will try to give a sensible answer. If you ask it to draw a picture, it will try its best to create something. Like all AI tools, it is fed enormous quantities of data in a process called training. The goal of training is to teach it to use data to complete a task - in the case of generative AI, the goal is to be able to make new things based on the data it has already seen1.

You could ask it ‚Äúcan you give me an oil painting of the Statue of Liberty holding a banana?‚Äù and it would attempt to create something that fits that prompt. Since it has already ‚Äúseen‚Äù thousands of pictures of New York and fruit during training, it can try to replicate the styles of those images. The magic is that it will most likely create something that does actually look like the Statue of Liberty holding a banana.


Aside from images, a form of generative AI known as a large language model (LLM) can be used. LLMs, like ChatGPT, are used to generate text. If you ask it:

‚ÄúCan you tell me about the IT consultancy Waterstons?‚Äù

it will respond:

‚ÄúCertainly! Waterstons is a UK-based business and IT consultancy firm that specializes in helping organizations with their technology and digital transformation needs. They offer a range of services and solutions to help businesses leverage technology effectively to achieve their goals‚Ä¶.‚Äù

which is correct! ChatGPT has seen almost all the text on the internet and will try to use it to create an answer to your question. When it‚Äôs creating a response it will ‚Äúask‚Äù itself ‚Äúwhat is the most likely word to come next?‚Äù and give you that word. It will ask itself that until it‚Äôs satisfied that the prompt has been answered. At a very simple level that is what these models are - a very powerful predictive text machine. As we mentioned earlier, AIs are trained on data. It‚Äôs this dependency on data that makes them so powerful and good at predicting the next word, but this dependency also makes them a potentially huge liability.

So, it can create text and images. So what?

### What can I actually do with it practically?
At first glance, the ability to generate text and images from a computer sounds almost like magic ‚Äì but practically, what can you achieve with it? How can this help your business? A machine that can randomly create data isn‚Äôt actually that useful unless you make it specific to you. You probably don‚Äôt need something that can make a picture of famous US landmarks holding fruit.

Recently, data has been used to automate things associated with numbers ‚Äì replacing Excel spreadsheets, building reports, and crunching numbers. Now though, we can also think about automating tasks involving words and pictures. At Waterstons, we have spoken to clients and partners about a range of projects they are interested in doing. These are spaces where they believe there is real value to be gained, and real efficiencies to eke out.

Drafting documentation: It is very good at generating large amounts of text, quickly. By training on internal documentation, it can be used to generate drafts of proposals and reports for a human to then finish. We have seen this use case, and the following one, come up repeatedly, whether it‚Äôs internally or externally with law firms, M&A companies, and fashion brands.

Handling text: There is a lot of manual processes related to managing documents ‚Äì summarising long Word files, taking parts from multiple files and merging them together, and understanding where files differ among many, many other activities. These menial tasks that involve natural language are a prime space for implementing a large language model to help automate.

Knowledge bases: You have gathered a huge amount of information about your company! Processes, previous projects, documentation, and an uncountable amount of other stuff. AI models can be trained on this to give a more user-friendly way of accessing this ocean of data. Instead of trawling through Sharepoint, you could just ask an AI a question. Could you even make it public facing to act as a customer service bot on a service desk? Tools that service desks use are already investigating this as a possibility, and clients of ours are internally testing their own in-house solutions for this.

Making more of what you have: A popular use case we see is to use image-generating tools to make new versions of the products you already make. Architects are using it to generate new ideas for buildings, production companies want to use it to generate new 3D models of sets, and shoe designers can use it to make new designs of sneakers. This takes only seconds and can be used as inspiration, or for a human designer to take away and refine.

Advertising: AI models have been trained on a huge amount of the internet ‚Äì it‚Äôs seen every viral tweet and ad campaign and everyone that never became viral. Combined with your catalogue of images of your product, can you use it to write viral content for you?

What unifies all these is the catalogue of data you already have for your company. Mostly, these do not use generic off-the-shelf models but rather something bespoke for you. The goal as well is not to replace human creativity, but to augment it. Ideally, it‚Äôs a tool to make people more efficient and automate away boring parts of their job. It can free them up to be creative and original ‚Äì something a human is amazing at, but AI cannot replicate.

Regardless of what you read, Generative AI won‚Äôt automate everything, and it can‚Äôt do everything. It will bring you the most value once you identify niches it can fill, and once you train it on your own data to specialise it to your business.

It‚Äôs a technology that has a long list of challenges to overcome. There is a different set of constraints when applying generative AI to a process, compared to undertaking a ‚Äústandard‚Äù software development project that you need to watch out for. Data security, the truth, biases, and more, are things that need to be deeply considered.

Next week, we will investigate the pitfalls and things you will need to consider when applying AI to your business, but also why we are still excited about the technology even when these risks exist.

### Andrew (Innovation Consultant)
This week I attended an eye-opening workshop at Proto in Gateshead. Megaverse, a digital experience company, were demonstrating how they use virtual production. I got a chance to see how they are making Game Changers, a live-action game they have been working on.

By using virtual production, actors can wear mocap suits and (in real-time) be placed into computer-generated sets that have been made earlier. The actions the actors do in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù in the production studio are mirrored on screen in the virtual world. Look at the image below - you can see that the actor in the mocap suit at the front is having her actions mirrored by the character on screen.


The Virtual Production stage at Proto, Gateshead.
What you can‚Äôt see is that also their faces and fingers are also being tracked and are being moved realistically, in real-time, on the screen too. Where they walk is also constantly being tracked, so as they move through Proto, they are also moving through the virtual space. It‚Äôs amazing.

Game Changers will be airing next week, live, and recorded this way. The audience will have the chance to vote, send messages, and play games, that will allow them to interact with the actors and affect the outcome of the show. You can sign up here!

Finally, please take a look at my SXSW PanelPicker application, and if you like the sound of it give it a vote! PanelPicker is part of the process of selecting sessions for SXSW 2024 - voting is open until August 20th! My proposed presentation is all about the dangers of overhyping technology, what AI might actually be useful for, and how open-source software might be able to provide a safer way to run an AI model.

## Roundup
We have a lot of exciting things happening in the Innovation team. We are problem-agnostic problem solvers. Over the next few weeks, we will go deeper into each project - whether they are successful or not!

ü¶† Mould Detection: We are looking to make Social Housing homes safer from mould and damp by designing software to give early warning signs. We have recently learned about awaretag‚Äôs - which may provide an interesting solution to this!

üêï Robot Dog: we are currently setting something up between a robotics lab and a client of ours. Can we use a robot dog to remove humans from dangerous environments?

ü§ñ AI Document Generation: writing documentation sucks: it‚Äôs boring and repetitive and not the most valuable use of your or your client‚Äôs time. Can we use modern AI models to speed up the process of writing draft documentation?
