# What is this? What is Innovation?
## Welcome To Waterstons Innovation!

### Waterstons Innovation
Whether it’s robot dogs, VR headsets, or Virtual Production Stages there is so much cool tech out there - but aside from looking rad, are these things useful at all? Here at Waterstons, we want to use this emerging tech to solve exciting and real-world challenges. By connecting our network of research groups, start-ups, and clients, we want to implement step-change solutions to people’s problems. Most of all, we want to share with you how to do it too.

To do this, we are going to work out loud, documenting our projects and the work we do to become more innovative. We will show our working, the things that have shaped our thinking, and the real efforts that go into making a thing happen (whether it goes well or not!). Everywhere we go, we find more and more incredible pieces of tech and more and more uniquely challenging problems. You can join us on this journey through this Substack.
