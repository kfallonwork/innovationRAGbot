# Everything You Wanted to Know About Generative AI (but were too afraid to ask) Part 2
## How to prepare yourself for AI - there's a lot of dangers you need to sidestep! Waterstons Innovation: The Dots #6

So, you want to make an AI. Your board is excited, your data team is excited, everyone is excited! But, let’s slow down a minute and think; there are a lot of potential issues here. How are you going to deal with data privacy, and biases, and copyright, and the truth, as well as everything else?

This is our “everything you wanted to know more about AI” series, where we are exploring the practical use cases of AI that we see our partners and clients do. In part 1, we defined it and looked at examples we have seen. Today, in Part 2, we will look at our concerns, recommendations on how to use and deploy it, and why we are excited.

But, what is this normally? This is The Dots, our newsletter about exciting things we find in the world of innovation. We imagine innovation as connecting the dots; putting together a jigsaw. Our puzzle pieces are the pieces of interesting information we absorb in the world, our partners and their products. Innovation happens when we connect these pieces in new and interesting ways. This newsletter is about these dots we find and connect.


### What do I need to be thinking about?
The board has signed a project off, and your data scientists are ready to go. However, how are you going to overcome all the challenges that using AI brings? Developing and deploying an AI model has a different set of challenges to making a ‘standard’ software solution. If this tool you make becomes publicly facing, it will represent your company; if it’s for internal process it will interfere with decision-making. An AI model will never be 100% accurate - are you happy to accept the errors?

Here are some of the issues we see come up regularly:

 * Data security and privacy: The AI models you use are typically run and trained by a company like OpenAI or Microsoft. When you send them your data, do you know what will happen to it? The default behaviour for a lot of these models is that your data will become part of the dataset used to train a future model. This means when you query the public version of ChatGPT in the future your data might be already inside it. Effectively, you can be making your data and IP publicly available!

 * Bias and discrimination: AI models gain their ‘knowledge’ from the data they are trained on. In fact, they can only know things that are based on this data, and because of this will echo what is in it. If your training set contains sexism, racism, homophobia, or other forms of discrimination, your model can output these behaviours too. Remember, a lot of these models have been trained on the internet, even some of the gruesome bits.

 * Creativity and originality: If these models have been trained on the internet, and can only understand what it is trained on, it follows that it cannot have an original thought. We don’t believe that any AI model out there can match human creativity and originality. AI models are parrots – only able to show you something it has seen before.

 * What is the truth? Generative AI models are trained to predict the next word to type or create an image that might look like the prompt you’ve given it. It has no understanding of the truth. If you play with any of these tools it won’t be long until it’s generated a human with 6 fingers or told you a ‘fact’ that is demonstrably untrue.

 * What does it know? If a model only knows what it has been trained on, what does it know about you? A generic version of ChatGPT will not know anything about the internal workings of your organisation. So, how useful is it? Maybe not very. These models can be retrained, or ‘fine-tuned’ to be more specific – to understand your business, your processes, and your documents.

### Why are we excited about it?
Even though there are lots of worrying things to consider when using generative AI, we are still very excited about it. We are realistic and pragmatic, but also believe that these tools can be used to build something that can change your business.

We see across every sector we work in that people are keen to increase their data maturity. They are excited to go on a journey to use data smarter, become data-driven, and automate decisions based on the patterns they have seen in the past. People are gathering more and more data as part of this, and getting better at storing, processing, and visualising it. The result of this is that many people are ready (or at least want to be ready) to experiment with using generative AI models based on their business’s own data.

As we mentioned last week, there are lots of boring everyday processes that it can help replace; drafting documents, summarising, and more, can be made more efficient. Generative AI allows a whole new category of processes to be looked at to see if they can be automated. Typically, automation pipelines focus on numbers – does this still have to be the case?

In the last year, AI tools have gotten cheaper and easier to use. Models which used to only be accessible in research labs are now available to the public. The technology is being democratised, with powerful generative AI models available open-source. This means you can host them yourself and train them with your own data, all without worrying that you will leak your data to the public.

## Glossary (aka: How does this compare to all the other buzzwords I hear?)

Data Scientists have created a lot of complex-sounding words to explain what AI does. Let's try to simplify it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a term that’s quite woolly and tough to define, but in general, it refers to the attempt to make a computer process information similar to how we humans do.

Machine Learning (ML) is a term that’s related to this, but more focused on how you apply this idea to actually solve problems. This works in a way that is quite different to how we expect computers to operate – normal computer programs require a human to write out the precise rules for how a program works. Instead, machine learning uses huge amounts of data to try to figure out the rules itself. Maybe you feed it lots of images of cats and dogs, and over time it learns to tell them apart.

There are a lot of machine learning methods you can choose to do this, each of these is called a model. A particularly popular model is a neural network, which if you draw on a piece of paper will kinda look like your brain. These dense and interlinked networks can become incredibly powerful, and if we make them big enough, form a whole subfield of AI called Deep Learning.

In 2023, AI has become shorthand for something like ChatGPT (which itself is actually a deep learning model). ChatGPT, and the other GPTs out there, are a form of Generative AI. Specifically, a Large Language Model – a generative AI model designed to handle text.

There you have it, now you know everything you need to know about Generative AI!
