## Connecting Everything, Everywhere. Waterstons Innovation: The Dots #13

You may have guessed that I find it difficult to switch my brain off. At Waterstons we talk about innovation being about connecting the dots between our clients and our partners in interesting ways but really this is just the tip of the innovation iceberg. Innovation is actually about joining the dots between everything, everywhere.

What is this? This is The Dots, our newsletter about exciting things we find in the world of innovation. We imagine innovation as connecting the dots; putting together a jigsaw. Our puzzle pieces are the pieces of interesting information we absorb in the world, our partners and their products. Innovation happens when we connect these pieces in new and interesting ways. This newsletter is about these dots we find and connect.

### Connecting Everything, Everywhere
I’m (Alex) writing this sitting on a rickety old chair at a beautiful wooden table in a converted barn. I’m on holiday with my family. We’re at an alpaca and goat rescue centre in the Peak District. It’s windy and rainy and feels a bit like I’m in a novel. Soon we will adventure into the wilds, tromping down valleys, wading across flooded stepping stones and buying sausage rolls from a hole in the wall in a village near here.

You may have guessed that I find it difficult to switch my brain off. At Waterstons we talk about innovation being about connecting the dots between our clients and our partners in interesting ways but really this is just the tip of the innovation iceberg. Innovation is actually about joining the dots between everything, everywhere. My own creative process thrives on disruptive and unexpected connections and my brain never stops making them.


I was reminded this week of a project I did at a hackathon in 2011 (oh my god I’m old). Culture Hack Scotland was one of the first hacks of its kind, bringing together creatives, technologists and cultural organisations from across Scotland for a frantic 24 hours of building madness. Museums, government bodies and universities all provided data and the public was let loose. The results were incredible - from a pair of robot jeans that danced to the beat of Edinburgh’s footfall data to apps that let you deep dive into the Fringe catalogue in unexpected ways. 

My project was driven by a desire to smash data together in totally unexpected ways. And so, with the invaluable help of an incredible artist called Jen Davies, an app called Steal It! was born. Steal It! was an iPhone game about stealing items from the National Museum of Scotland’s collections. The items were scattered about Fringe venues across the city and players had to visit those physical locations to grab the virtual loot.


Steal It! did overwhelmingly well at the hack and there is an interesting story about how the National Museum felt about that (especially about us assigning random monetary values to every item) but it’s a tale for someone else to tell one day. What I’m interested in here though is how creativity and innovation was borne out of taking two puzzle pieces that shouldn’t have fit together and applying a thick layer of glue and sellotape to make something funny and fabulous and disruptive but most of all fun.

I’ve often said that innovation is ‘just really good consultancy’. When you start a new consultancy gig you often only have a vague idea of the direction you’re going to take. It’s frequently terrifying as you start interviewing people and they keep saying things you do not understand, you gather data and artefacts without knowing where they fit, you look at things and don’t know whether they’re important but you just don’t know it yet. Over time though these puzzle pieces start to click together, the dots start to connect and you begin drawing lines of influence and effect. A picture begins to form and you start surprising your interviewees with insights that hadn’t crossed their mind. 

For me, innovation is like this but instead of the puzzle pieces being in a business-shaped box the puzzle pieces are everything and the box is the universe. Curiosity and inquisitiveness drive me to be the ultimate generalist - understanding a little bit about as much as possible. I’m constantly treading that fine line between knowing just enough to be dangerous and just enough to know that there’s something worth exploring here.

So I find it difficult to turn my brain off and as I sit here at this beautiful table looking out the window onto the peaks I find myself wondering whether you could sell really good consultancy out of a hole in the wall in central Manhattan or if you could use generative AI to tell compelling stories using traceability data in farming. And, to be honest, I’m ok with the creative parts of my brain being always on, always whirring, always joining random dots and smooshing odd puzzle pieces together because sometimes it leads to amazing avenues for exploration and sometimes it results in a weird little idea I can turn into a joke or a story to amuse my incredibly patient family or the listeners of the world’s most creative podcast.

I did my expenses in VR and I liked it: An article where someone tried to wear their new Oculus Quest 3 for as much of the day as they could. They made their coffee and washed their dishes. Does it sound enjoyable? I don’t know about that. Have a read and make up your own mind though.
